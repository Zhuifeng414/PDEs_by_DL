# PDEs_by_DL
This repository hosts a PyTorch implementation for the paper 
'Solving Fokker-Planck equation using deep learning' by Yong Xu, Hao Zhang et al.

It will be different from the original paper due some implement detail(I use two approaches to
implement how to get deriviate of neural network).

## Run the code
``python train.py --phase='difference'``

``python train.py --phase='deriviate'``

## Result
